## A. Introduction

AI Agents represent the evolution of Large Language Models (LLMs) from passive text processors to active problem solving systems. They combine language understanding with strategic planning, reasoning and tool manipulation capabilities to perform complex tasks autonomously. 

For AI systems to be efficient, LLMs must access the real world, like calling search tools for external data or interacting with external programs/tools to complete tasks. In essence, LLMs need [agency](https://huggingface.co/docs/smolagents/conceptual_guides/intro_agents), as agentic systems connect LLMs to the outside world.

### Agency Levels 

Adapted from [Huggingface Agent Guide](https://huggingface.co/docs/smolagents/conceptual_guides/intro_agents) and [Anthropic Effective Agent Guide](https://www.anthropic.com/research/building-effective-agents)

The Agentic AI based system supports different levels of agency, progressing from simple to advanced:

1. **No Agency**: Basic text processing & text generation
2. **Basic**: Simple decision-making and prompt chaining
3. **Intermediate**: Tool usage and task decomposition
4. **Advanced**: Full autonomous operation with complex workflows

Each level corresponds to specific capabilities:
- **Simple Processing** → Basic Text Generation with zero shot or few shot in-context learning
- **Decision Making** → Prompt Chaining, Routing, Parallelization, Evaluation & Optimization
- **Tool Usage** → API Integration
- **Full Control** → Multi-Step and Autonomous Agents

### Agency Level Selection Guide

#### High Agency Scenarios
- Complex, open ended tasks
- Dynamic decision requirements
- Strong feedback mechanisms
- Clear success metrics

#### Low Agency Scenarios
- Simple, predictable tasks
- Fixed workflows
- Cost/latency trade-off
- Limited tool requirements

## B. Core Components

### 1. Operational Cycle

![Operation Cycle](images/operational-cycle.png)

The AI Agent operates in a four phase cycle:

1. Perception
   - Understanding context
   - Processing input
   - Pattern recognition
   - Prompt analysis

2. Planning
   - ReAct, Chain-of-thought, Tree of Thought, Reflexion etc reasoning
   - Step definition
   - Tool selection
   - Task decomposition

3. Action
   - Tool utilization
   - Output validation
   - Error handling

4. Learning
   - Result analysis
   - Strategy adaptation
   - Response evaluation
   - Pattern optimization

### 2. Memory

The memory in Agentic AI consists of these key components:

- **Conversation Memory (Context Memory)**
   - Maintains dialogue context
   - Essential for coherent back-and-forth interaction
   - Helps maintain conversation flow

- **Working Memory**
   - Holds current task information
   - Stores intermediate results
   - Manages active goals and plans

- **Tool Memory**
   - Tracks tool usage and results
   - Prevents redundant tool calls
   - Helps in decision making about tool selection

- **State Memory**
   - Maintains agent's current state
   - Allows state tracking and rollback
   - Useful for complex workflows

- **Episodic Memory**
   - Stores complete interaction episodes
   - Enables learning from past experiences
   - Supports similarity-based retrieval
   - Maintains contextual information

- **Long-term Memory**
   - Stores acquired knowledge
   - Maintains learned patterns
   - Tracks usage statistics
   - Supports pattern learning

These memories in Autonomous Agents are crucial for:
- Learning from past interactions
- Improving decision making over time
- Maintaining knowledge persistence
- Supporting pattern recognition
- Enabling experience based responses

### 3. Tool Integration

The agent can access various resources:
- **APIs**: External service integration
- **Databases**: Data storage and retrieval
- **Code Execution**: Runtime environment
- **Custom Tools**: Specialized functionalities
