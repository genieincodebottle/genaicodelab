## AI Agents - A Practical Approach

### 🤖 What are AI Agents? 

AI Agents are the next evolution of Large Language Models (LLMs). Instead of just processing text, they can:
- Actively solve complex problems
- Make strategic decisions
- Use tools and APIs
- Learn from interactions
- Work autonomously

Think of an AI Agent as an LLM with hands and a brain, it can understand, plan and interact with the real world through tools and APIs.

### 📊 Understanding Agency Levels 

In essence, LLMs need [agency](https://huggingface.co/docs/smolagents/conceptual_guides/intro_agents), as agentic systems connect LLMs to the outside world.

Agency refers to how independently an AI system can operate. Here's what each level means:

#### Level 0: No Agency
- Basic text processing
- Simple input/output operations
- Like a smart autocomplete

#### Level 1: Basic Agency
- Can make simple decisions
- Handles structured tasks
- Uses basic prompt chaining

#### Level 2: Intermediate Agency
- Uses external tools
- Breaks down complex tasks
- Makes informed decisions

#### Level 3: Advanced Agency
- Works autonomously
- Handles complex workflows
- Self-improves over time

### 🎯 When to Use Each Agency Level? 

#### Choose High Agency When You Need:
- Complex problem solving
- Dynamic decision making
- Strong feedback loops
- Clear performance metrics

#### Choose Low Agency When You Have:
- Simple, repetitive tasks
- Fixed workflows
- Budget constraints
- Limited tool requirements

### ⚙️ How Do AI Agents Work? 

#### The Operation Cycle

1. **Perceive** 👀
   - Understands context
   - Processes input
   - Recognizes patterns

2. **Plan** 🗺️
   - Reasons about the task
   - Chooses tools
   - Breaks down problems

3. **Act** 🎯
   - Uses tools
   - Validates results
   - Handles errors

4. **Learn** 📚
   - Analyzes outcomes
   - Adapts strategies
   - Improves over time

### 🧠 Memory Systems 

AI Agents use different types of memory to function effectively:

#### Short-Term Memory
- **Conversation Memory**: Keeps track of current dialogue
- **Working Memory**: Handles active tasks and immediate goals

#### Long-Term Memory
- **Tool Memory**: Records how to use different tools
- **Episodic Memory**: Stores past experiences
- **Knowledge Memory**: Maintains learned information

### 🛠️ Tool Integration 

AI Agents can interact with various external tools and resources:

- **APIs**: Connect to external services
- **Databases**: Store and retrieve data
- **Code Execution**: Run runtime environments
- **Custom Tools**: Handle specialized tasks
